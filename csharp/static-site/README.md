This example creates the infrastructure for a static site, which uses an S3 bucket for storing the content.  The site contents (located in the 'site-contents' sub-directory) are deployed to the bucket.

The site redirects from HTTP to HTTPS, using a CloudFront distribution, Route53 alias record, and ACM certificate.

## Prep

The domain for the static site (i.e. mystaticsite.com) must be configured as a hosted zone in Route53 prior to deploying this example.  For instructions on configuring Route53 as the DNS service for your domain, see the [Route53 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-configuring.html).

In `Program.cs` the declared account number `Account = "111111111"` needs to be replaced with the account number of the account configured in your AWS CLI. To find this number execute `aws sts get-caller-identity` in your terminal, and use the account value found there.

## Deploy

```
$ npm install -g aws-cdk
$ dotnet build src
$ cdk deploy StaticSiteStack -c domain=mystaticsite.com -c subdomain=www
```

Enjoy!
