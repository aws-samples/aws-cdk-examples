This section contains all the CDK code examples written in .NET. At the moment, the CDK only supports .NET Core projects. For more information on using the CDK in .NET, please see the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-csharp.html).

## Running Examples

```
$ npm install -g aws-cdk
$ cd csharp/EXAMPLE_DIRECTORY
$ cdk deploy
```

Then, to dispose of the stack afterwards:

```
$ cdk destroy
```
