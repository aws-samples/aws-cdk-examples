about your experience through GitHub issues.

## Deploy

After the deployment you will see the public IP, which can be used to access the instance.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
