# Rekognition Lambda S3 Trigger


## How it works

This project creates the following in your AWS account:

- S3 bucket
- DynamoDB table
- Lambda function that performs image classification via AWS Rekognition when new images are uploaded to the S3 bucket
- Roles and policies allowing appropriate access to these resources
- Rekognition labels are written to the DynamoDb table.

## Deploy
Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

## Manage GO dependencies
Run `go mod tidy`

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template
To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`.
