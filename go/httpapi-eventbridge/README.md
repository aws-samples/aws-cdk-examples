# Amazon API Gateway HTTP API to Amazon EventBridge

This pattern creates an HTTP API endpoint that directly integrates with Amazon EventBridge

## How it works

This pattern creates an Amazon API gateway HTTP API endpoint. The endpoint uses service integrations to directly connect to Amazon EventBridge. An EventBridge rule sends all events to Cloudwatch Logs.

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

## Testing

To test the endpoint first send data using the following command. Be sure to update the endpoint with endpoint of your stack.

```
curl --location --request POST '<your api endpoint>' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "Detail":{
        "message": "This is my test"
    }
}'
```

Then check the logs in Cloudwatch logs.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template
To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
