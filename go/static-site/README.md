# Static Site

 This example deploys static to an S3 bucket.

 The site redirects from HTTP to HTTPS, using a CloudFront distribution,
 Route53 alias record, and ACM certificate.

**NOTICE**: Go support is still in Developer Preview. This implies that APIs may
change while we address early feedback from the community. We would love to hear
about your experience through GitHub issues.

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

This example expects context to provide a domain name for the initial deployment.

`cdk deploy -c domain=example.com`

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
