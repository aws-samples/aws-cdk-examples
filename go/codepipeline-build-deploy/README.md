## Overview

This AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) Go example demonstrates how to configure AWS CodePipeline with CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to build and deploy a Docker image to an Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster running [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) (serverless compute for containers).

## Real-world Example

When working in fast-paced development environments, CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) pipelines are used to automatically build, test, and deploy application changes across multiple accounts and environments. This allows new features and bug fixes to be tested and deployed quickly to continuously improve the application.

## Requirements

- [Go v1.20.x](https://go.dev/)
- [AWS CDK v2.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)

## AWS Services Utilized

- CodePipeline
- CodeCommit
- CodeBuild
- CodeDeploy
- Elastic Container Service (ECS)
- Fargate
- Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- Lambda

## Deploying

- Authenticate to an AWS account via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
- Navigate to this `codepipeline-build-deploy` directory.
- Run `go mod tidy` to set up the required dependencies.
- `cdk synth` to generate and review the CloudFormation template.
- `cdk diff` to compare local changes with what is currently deployed.
- `go test` to run the tests we specify in `codepipeline-build-deploy_test.go`.
- `cdk deploy` to deploy the stack to the AWS account you're authenticated to.

## Output

After a successful deployment, CDK will output a public endpoint for:

- Application Load Balancer (ALB)

## Testing

- To test that the Docker image was built and deployed successfully to ECS, we can use the Application Load Balancer (ALB) public endpoint, e.g. `http://xyz123.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`.
- The simple containerized application contains multiple pages for testing:
  - `/index.html`
  - `/about.html`
  - `/contact.html`
  - `/error.html`
- Navigate to the AWS CodePipeline console and select `ImageBuildDeployPipeline`. Then click on `Release change` to trigger the pipeline and observe the workflow in action end-to-end.
- Navigate to the AWS Console to view the services that were deployed:
  - CodePipeline pipeline
  - CodeCommit repository
  - CodeBuild project
  - CodeDeploy application
  - ECS cluster
  - ECS service on Fargate
  - ECR image repository
  - Lambda functions

## Further Improvements

- Add [manual approval actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/approvals-action-add.html) to the CodePipeline workflow.
- [Deploy to multiple accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployments-cross-account.html) with CodeDeploy.
- Set up Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository [cross-account or cross-region replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/replication.html).
- Protect the public Application Load Balancer (ALB) from attacks and malicious traffic using [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html).
- [Enable SSL/TLS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html) at the Application Load Balancer (ALB) using AWS Certificate Manager.
- Set up a [Route 53 domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-elb-load-balancer.html) to route traffic to an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
