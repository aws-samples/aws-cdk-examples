**NOTICE**: Go support is still in Developer Preview. This implies that APIs may
change while we address early feedback from the community. We would love to hear
about your experience through GitHub issues.

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

After the deployment you will see the API's URL, which represents the url you can then use.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
