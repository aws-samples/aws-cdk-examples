# Amazon API Gateway Rest API to AWS Lambda

This example creates a rest api toghether with a simple lambda function returning *hello world!*

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

After the deployment you will see the API's URL, which represents the url you can then use to execute the lambda function.

### Synthesize Cloudformation Template
To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
