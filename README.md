# AWS CDK Examples

This repository contains a set of example projects for the [AWS Cloud Development
Kit](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk). Some examples are only available in TypeScript, there is a guide on how to read TypeScript code and translate it to Python [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/multiple_languages.html).

## TypeScript examples <a name="TypeScript"></a>

To run a TypeScript example, say my-widget-service:

```
$ npm install -g aws-cdk
$ cd typescript/my-widget-service
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ cdk deploy  // Deploys the CloudFormation template

# Afterwards
$ cdk destroy
```
