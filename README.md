## About this Repo <a name="About"></a>
This repo is our official list of CDK example code. The repo is subdivided into sections for each language (see ["Examples"](#Examples)). Each language has its own subsection of examples with the ultimate aim of complete language parity (same subset of examples exist in each language). These examples each provide a demonstration of a common service implementation, or infrastructure pattern that could be useful in your use of the CDK for building your own infrastructure.

We welcome contributions to this repo in the form of fixes to existing examples or addition of new examples. For more information on contributing, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

This is considered an intermediate learning resource and should typically be referenced after reading the Developer Guide or CDK Workshop (please see [Learning Resources](#Learning) for more information on these resources).

## Examples <a name="Examples"></a>
This repo contains examples in each language supported by the CDK. Some languages are fully supported by [JSII](https://github.com/aws/jsii), but as additional languages are added, you will see those marked as `Developer Preview`. You can find the examples for each of those languages at the following links:
