# extract-snippets.sh v1.1.0
# Jerry Kindall, Amazon Web Services

# this script manages updating of snippets found in source code to the snippets branch

# the args to this script constitute the command that is executed to get the list of source
# files to be processed.  for example, if it is run on push, pass e.g.: git diff @^ --name-only
# to process only the files included in the last push.  to process all files, pass e.g.:
# find . --type f

# snippets are never deleted, as this would break any document where they're used.
