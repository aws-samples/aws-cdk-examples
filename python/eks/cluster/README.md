# Create an EKS cluster and a node group in a new VPC

This example includes:

* Own VPC with public and private subnets
* EKS cluster with node group
* Manually management auto scaling group attached to a node group

## Python setup

This project is set up like a standard Python project. The initialization process also creates a virtualenv within this
project, stored under the `.env` directory. To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3` (or `python`
for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv` package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the
virtualenv fails, you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .env
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .env/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

## CDK Deploy

There are some command examples you can follow to bootstrap your environment and deploy the stack.

### With default profile

```
$ cdk bootstrap
```

### With specific profile

```
$ cdk bootstrap --profile test
```

### Deploying after the bootstrap

```
$ cdk deploy
```

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
