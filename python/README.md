# Python Examples

![Language-Support: Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/language--support-stable-success.svg?style=for-the-badge)

This section contains all the CDK code examples written in Python. For more information on using the CDK in Python, please see the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-python.html).

## Running Examples

### To run example
1. Ensure CDK is installed
```
$ npm install -g aws-cdk
```

2. Create a Python virtual environment
```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

3. Activate virtual environment

_On MacOS or Linux_
```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

_On Windows_
```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

4. Install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Synthesize (`cdk synth`) or deploy (`cdk deploy`) the example

```
$ cdk deploy
```

### To dispose of the stack afterwards:

```
$ cdk destroy
```
