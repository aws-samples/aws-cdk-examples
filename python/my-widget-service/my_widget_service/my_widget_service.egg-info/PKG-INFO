Description: 
        # Welcome to your CDK Python project!
        
        This is a blank project for Python development with CDK.
        
        The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.
        
        This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
        process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the .env
        directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
        (or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
        package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
        you can create the virtualenv manually.
        
        To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:
        
        ```
        $ python3 -m venv .env
        ```
        
        After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
        step to activate your virtualenv.
        
        ```
        $ source .env/bin/activate
        ```
        
        If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:
        
        ```
        % .env\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
        
        Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.
        
        ```
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.
        
        ```
        $ cdk synth
        ```
        
        To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
        them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        command.
        
        # Useful commands
        
         * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
         * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
         * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
         * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
         * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
        
        Enjoy!
