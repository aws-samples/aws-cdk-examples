# Fargate Service using EFS
This example creates a Public Facing load balanced Fargate service with an EFS Filesystem mount to demo the
recently added feature to Fargate.

Is based on this blog post: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ecs-supports-efs/

## Build

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

You can now begin exploring the source code, contained in the hello directory.
There is also a very trivial test included that can be run like this:

```
$ pytest
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add to
your requirements.txt file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
