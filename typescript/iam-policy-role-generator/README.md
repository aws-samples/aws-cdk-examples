# IAM Policy Role Generator

This CDK Project helps create IAM Managed Policies and IAM Roles using JSON Configuration 


## Prerequsites

Place all the Policy Json files inside config/policy folder and policy file would look something like this:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "codecommit:CancelUploadArchive",
        "codecommit:UploadArchive"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Configure the policies and roles to be created in config/iam_generator_config.json file and would look something like this:

```json
{
    "policies": [     
        {
            "policy_name": "CodeCommitArchive",
            "description": "CodeCommitArchive policy",
            "policy_file": "CodeCommitArchive.json"
        },
        {
            "policy_name": "KMSPolicy",
            "description": "KMSPolicy policy",
            "policy_file": "KMSPolicy.json"
        },
        {
            "policy_name": "CreateServiceLinkedRoleECS",
            "description": "CreateServiceLinkedRoleECS policy",
            "policy_file": "CreateServiceLinkedRoleECS.json"
        },
        {
            "policy_name": "DeployService1",
            "description": "DeployService1 policy",
            "policy_file": "DeployService1.json"
        },
        {
            "policy_name": "DeployService2",
            "description": "DeployService2 policy",
            "policy_file": "DeployService2.json"
        }
    ],
    "roles": [
        {
            "role_name": "TestRole1",
            "trust_service_principal": ["apigateway.amazonaws.com","lambda.amazonaws.com"],
            "customer_managed_policies": ["DeployService1","DeployService2","KMSPolicy"],
            "aws_managed_policies": ["service-role/AmazonAPIGatewayPushToCloudWatchLogs"]
        },
        {
            "role_name": "TestRole2",
            "trust_service_principal": ["sns.amazonaws.com"],
            "trust_account_principal": ["748669239283"],
            "customer_managed_policies": ["CreateServiceLinkedRoleECS","CodeCommitArchive","KMSPolicy"],
            "aws_managed_policies": ["service-role/AmazonAPIGatewayPushToCloudWatchLogs"]
        },
        {
            "role_name": "TestRole3",
            "trust_service_principal": ["ec2.amazonaws.com","sns.amazonaws.com"],
            "trust_account_principal": ["748669239283"],
            "customer_managed_policies": ["DeployService2","CodeCommitArchive","KMSPolicy"],
            "aws_managed_policies": ["AWSLambdaFullAccess"]
        }
        
    ]
}
```
## Build

To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:
```
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install
npm run build
```
This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.


## Deploy

 * Run `cdk ls `. This will list out IamPolicyGeneratorStack and IamRoleGeneratorStack.
 * Run `cdk deploy IamPolicyGeneratorStack`. This will create the IAM Managed Policies from config/policy folder and  configured in config/iam_generator_config.json .
 * Run `cdk deploy IamRoleGeneratorStack`. This will create the IAM Roles configured in config/iam_generator_config.json. This stack has a dependency to IamPolicyGeneratorStack to ensure that policies are created before they are being used in the roles in config/iam_generator_config.json. 

# Useful CDK commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk ls`          list cdk stacks in the app
