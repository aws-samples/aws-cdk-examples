```

### 2. Deploy the certificates

Next, let's deploy the certificates with aws-cdk.

```console
npx cdk deploy
```

or

```console
yarn cdk deploy
```

### 3. Confirm to work the certificates

Finally, let's confirm to work the certificates with getting and updating the
device shadow as following:

```console
./shadow-get
```

and

```console
./shadow-update
```
