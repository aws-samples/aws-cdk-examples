This example creates a new EventBridge rule that executes a Lambda function every minute and sends you and email via a lambda that calls a SNS topic


## Build

To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install
npm run build
```

This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy --parameters email=<email_address>` replacing <email_address> with your email. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account and start sending email notifications to yourself every 1 minute

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
