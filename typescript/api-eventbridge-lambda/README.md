<!--END STABILITY BANNER-->

Creates an API Gateway API with a POST Method, a Lambda as data Producer, EventBridge that can route to different AWS srvices based on the Rule, two Lambda functions for consumption of data based on different Rules , and a Kinesis Firehose that takes data from eventbridge based on Rule to store data in to S3 bucket for every 60 sec.
Requests to the API are sent to eventbridge using the producer Lambda, which triggers the Consumer Lambda functions and KinesisFirehose based on the Rule.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Build

To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install
npm run build
```

This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

After the deployment you will see the API's URL, which represents the url you can then use.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.

## Testing the app

Upon successful deployment, you should see an API Gateway REST API in your account. It can be tested from the console or the CLI:

[Validate Deployment](Validate_sample.pdf)

or

```
$ aws apigateway test-invoke-method --rest-api-id <API ID> --resource-id <RESOURCE ID> --http-method POST --body {"item1":"123","item2":"234"}
```

This request should complete with a 200 OK. The Lambda function should print the API Gateway request body in its CloudWatch logs. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-cloudwatchlogs.html)

This message will also be visible in the S3 bucket that has been created by KinesisFirehose. Also you should be able to see the event in Consumer Lambda's cloudwatch logs.

## Cleanup

You can either delete the stack through the AWS CloudFormation console or run `cdk destroy`.
