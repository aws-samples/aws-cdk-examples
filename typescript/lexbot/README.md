# LexBot Example
This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

This example creates a bot to book hotel rooms and rental cars. As mentioned in CFN documenation :https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lex-bot.html#aws-resource-lex-bot--examples

This example will create:
1. IAM Role used by the Lex service to make runtime calls
2. Inline bot definition which depends on the IAM role
3. Define a bot version which depends on the DRAFT version of the Lex Bot
4. We define the alias by providing the bot version created by the AWS::Lex::BotVersion resource above

## Language

Typescript

## Build

To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install
npm run build
```

This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.


## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
