This example creates an AutoScalingGroup (containing a Micro-T2 EC2 machine running the Amazon Linux AMI), and an ApplicationLoadBalancer inside a shared VPC. It hooks up an open listener from the Load Balancer to the Scaling Group to indicate how many targets to balance between.

For more info on using Auto Scaling with Load Balancing see the AutoScaling guide [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-load-balancer.html).


## Build

To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install
npm run build
```

This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

After the deployment you will see the API's URL, which represents the url you can then use.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
