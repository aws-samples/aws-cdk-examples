## Overview

CDK example to create a [S3 Object Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transforming-objects.html) that uses Typescript.
The example demonstrates setting up a S3 Access Point, Object Lambda Access Point and an Object Lambda to process the GET object requests using CDK.

Once deployed, any uploaded object in the bucket created will be available through the Object Access Point.
When trying to access an object, you will see an object metadata output generated by the lambda similar to the following:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "length": 1048576,
    "md5": "b6d81b360a5672d80c27430f39153e2c",
    "sha1": "3b71f43ff30f4b15b5cd85dd9e95ebc7e84eb5a3",
    "sha256": "30e14955ebf1352266dc2ff8067e68104607e750abb9d3b36582b8af909fcb58"
  }
}
```

## Build and Deploy

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

Before getting ready to deploy, ensure the dependencies are installed by executing the following:

```
$ npm install -g aws-cdk
$ npm install
```

### CDK Deploy

With specific profile,
```
$ cdk deploy --profile test
```

Using the default profile

```
$ cdk deploy
```
