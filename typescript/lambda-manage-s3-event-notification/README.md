This example uses Lambda to manage event notifications for an S3 bucket. The solution allows other stacks to define their own event notifications on a shared bucket.

## Build
To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:
```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install
npm run build
```
This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy
Run ```cdk deploy```. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

After the deployment you will see the API's URL, which represents the url you can then use.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template
To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run cdk synth, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.

## The Component Structure
This whole component contains:
* A shared resources stack with an S3 bucket shared by multiple stacks and a Lambda function which manages the S3 bucket event notifications
* A stack to configure S3 event notifications on the shared bucket to an SQS queue
* A stack to configure S3 event notifications on the shared bucket to an SNS topic
