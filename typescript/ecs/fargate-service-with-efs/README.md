# Fargate Service using EFS
This example creates a Public Facing load balanced Fargate service with an EFS Filesystem mount to demo the
recently added feature to Fargate.

Is based on this blog post: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ecs-supports-efs/

Also gives examples of using the following:

* AWS SDK Api call Custom resource to create Efs Access Point (not currently supported by cfn)
* Lambda Custom Resource to create ECS TaskDefinition with EFS Mount (not currently supported by cfn) & initiate an update of the service
* Cfn property override to set Fargate Service' PlatformVersion' to '1.4.0' (not currently tagged as Latest)


## Build

To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install
npm run build
```

This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

After the deployment you will see the API's URL, which represents the url you can then use.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
