# AppSync GraphQL API with four resolvers CRUD with DynamoDB

This an example of an AppSync GraphQL API, pointing to four resolvers doing CRUD operations with a single DynamoDB table.

## The Component Structure

This Stack contains:

- a GraphQL API with an API Key (Use with caution, each key is only valid for 7 days.)
- a GraphQL Schema with Queries to get one and all items and two mutations to save and delete an item
- a DynamoDB table `items` that stores the data with a Pay Per Request Billing Mode
- an IAM Role that allows AppSync to invoke your DynamoDB table.
- a DataSource, connecting your API to the DynamoDB table with the previously specified role.
- a Resolver for a Query `getOne` to get one item from the DynamoDB table.
- a Resolver for a Query `all` to get all items from the DynamoDB table.
- a Resolver for a Mutation `save` to put an item into the DynamoDB table (the id is autogenerated, you need only name).
- a Resolver for a Mutation `delete` to delete one item from the DynamoDB table.
